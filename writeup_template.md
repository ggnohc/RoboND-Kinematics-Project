**Steps to complete the project:**  


1. Set up your ROS Workspace.
2. Download or clone the [project repository](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Kinematics-Project) into the ***src*** directory of your ROS Workspace.  
3. Experiment with the forward_kinematics environment and get familiar with the robot.
4. Launch in [demo mode](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd209/parts/7b2fd2d7-e181-401e-977a-6158c77bf816/modules/8855de3f-2897-46c3-a805-628b5ecf045b/lessons/91d017b1-4493-4522-ad52-04a74a01094c/concepts/ae64bb91-e8c4-44c9-adbe-798e8f688193).
5. Perform Kinematic Analysis for the robot following the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/972/view).
6. Fill in the `IK_server.py` with your Inverse Kinematics code.

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/972/view) Points
### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  

You're reading it!

### Kinematic Analysis
#### 1. Run the forward_kinematics demo and evaluate the kr210.urdf.xacro file to perform kinematic analysis of Kuka KR210 robot and derive its DH parameters.

Here is an example of how to include an image in your writeup.

* Below is the Kuka 210 as shown in Rviz, with links labelled.
![alt text][forward_kinematics.rviz]

* Below is the DH table populated (more details on extraction steps as below)

i | alpha(i-1) | a(i-1) | d(i) | theta(i)
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
2 | - pi/2 | 0 | 0 | 0
3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
4 |  pi | 0 | 0 | 0
5 | - pi | 0 | 0 | 0
6 | - pi | 0 | 0 | 0
EE | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0

  * alpha(i−1)​​ (twist angle) = angle between ​Z​(​​​i−1)​​ and ​Z​(i)​​ measured about ​X​(​​​i−1)​​ in a right-hand sense.

  ![Insert sketch for kr210 joint and link here][DH_diagram]

  * a(i-1)​​ (link length) = distance from ​Z​(i−1)​​ to ​Z​(i)​​ measured along ​X​(i-1)​​​​​ where ​X​(i-1)​​ is perpendicular to both ​Z​(i−1)​​ to ​Z​(i)​​​

From "kr210.urdf.xacro' file except below, the "a" parameter can be obtained from **X** or **Z** value of "origin" field depending on axis orientation

```xml
  </joint>
  <joint name="joint_1" type="revolute">
    <origin xyz="0 0 0.33" rpy="0 0 0"/>
    <parent link="base_link"/>
    <child link="link_1"/>
    <axis xyz="0 0 1"/>
    <limit lower="${-185*deg}" upper="${185*deg}" effort="300" velocity="${123*deg}"/>
  </joint>
  <joint name="joint_2" type="revolute">
    <origin xyz="0.35 0 0.42" rpy="0 0 0"/>
    <parent link="link_1"/>
    <child link="link_2"/>
    <axis xyz="0 1 0"/>
    <limit lower="${-45*deg}" upper="${85*deg}" effort="300" velocity="${115*deg}"/>
  </joint>
  <joint name="joint_3" type="revolute">
    <origin xyz="0 0 1.25" rpy="0 0 0"/>
    <parent link="link_2"/>
    <child link="link_3"/>
    <axis xyz="0 1 0"/>
    <limit lower="${-210*deg}" upper="${(155-90)*deg}" effort="300" velocity="${112*deg}"/>
  </joint>
  <joint name="joint_4" type="revolute">
    <origin xyz="0.96 0 -0.054" rpy="0 0 0"/>
    <parent link="link_3"/>
    <child link="link_4"/>
    <axis xyz="1 0 0"/>
    <limit lower="${-350*deg}" upper="${350*deg}" effort="300" velocity="${179*deg}"/>
  </joint>
  <joint name="joint_5" type="revolute">
    <origin xyz="0.54 0 0" rpy="0 0 0"/>
    <parent link="link_4"/>
    <child link="link_5"/>
    <axis xyz="0 1 0"/>
    <limit lower="${-125*deg}" upper="${125*deg}" effort="300" velocity="${172*deg}"/>
  </joint>
  <joint name="joint_6" type="revolute">
    <origin xyz="0.193 0 0" rpy="0 0 0"/>
    <parent link="link_5"/>
    <child link="link_6"/>
    <axis xyz="1 0 0"/>
    <limit lower="${-350*deg}" upper="${350*deg}" effort="300" velocity="${219*deg}"/>
  </joint>
```

  * d​(i)​​ (link offset) = signed distance from ​X​(i-1)​​ to ​X​(i) measured along ​Z​(i)​.
  * theta(i)​​ (joint angle) = angle between ​X​(i-1)​​ to ​X​(i) measured about ​Z​(i) in a right-hand sense. A variable since all kr210 joints are revolute joint

#### 2. Using the DH parameter table you derived earlier, create individual transformation matrices about each joint. In addition, also generate a generalized homogeneous transform between base_link and gripper_link using only end-effector(gripper) pose.

Links | alpha(i-1) | a(i-1) | d(i-1) | theta(i)
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
0->1 | 0 | 0 | L1 | qi
1->2 | - pi/2 | L2 | 0 | -pi/2 + q2
2->3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
3->4 |  0 | 0 | 0 | 0
4->5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
5->6 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
6->EE | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0


#### 3. Decouple Inverse Kinematics problem into Inverse Position Kinematics and inverse Orientation Kinematics; doing so derive the equations to calculate all individual joint angles.

And here's where you can draw out and show your math for the derivation of your theta angles.

### Project Implementation

#### 1. Fill in the `IK_server.py` file with properly commented python code for calculating Inverse Kinematics based on previously performed Kinematic Analysis. Your code must guide the robot to successfully complete 8/10 pick and place cycles. Briefly discuss the code you implemented and your results.


Here I'll talk about the code, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the implementation might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
